    <h1>Speaker Information</h1>

    First, thanks for agreeing to speak. It helps a lot to have great talks and interesting speakers. We appreciate the time and effort that you have put into your talks.

    <h2>Contact Information</h2>

My phone number is 703 727-1307. Please email me yours, just in case.

    <h2>Register and Check-In</h2>

Please register for the conference, if you haven't done so. It helps us to have a complete list. Use the code fr2023speaker

https://frontrunners.ticketleap.com/frontrunners2022/
    
Also, please check in with the registration desk when you arrive. Tell them you are a speaker so we can check off that list, too.

    <h2>Speakers Dinner</h2>

If you haven't RSVP'd yet, please go to https://capitalgo.ticketleap.com/nationconfs-speakers-dinner/

That link is for RubyNation and CapitalGo.

    <h2>Video Adapters</h2>

Please bring your video adapter (to VGA or HDMI). I and the other organizers will have some, but sometimes even those walk away and we are left looking for one at the last minute. I have adapters from USB-C to VGA and HDMI, and also mini-display port to VGA and HDMI.

    <h2>Try the Projection</h2>

Please try your presentation as soon as you can after you get there, either in the morning or a break. Make sure you have the mirroring, resolution, etc. set up the way you want before your talk. It is much better to have issues with those things solved way before your talk.

The projectors are all new this year. So, the flickering we saw last year is gone, and the brightness of the projection is much better.

    <h2>Wifi</h2>

Wifi will be available, but as always it might work! It might not work during your talk. Please do not depend upon it. Have your presentation on your laptop. You will need to get a wireless account there. It is similar to the way hotels do it. I've attached a PDF with the instructions.

The projection is supposed to handle 16:9 or 4:3, but 16:9 looks better.

    <h2>Your Talk Itself</h2>

Please try to keep your talk to its scheduled length, and please start at your scheduled time. This will give some time for the following speaker to set up, and not go into the break times.

The schedule is here:

    <h2>Lunch</h2>

We will go out to lunch in groups. We will pay for speaker lunches, so please get a $20 bill from the registration desk or me (Gray) for that before you go out.

    <h2>Twitter</h2>

Tweet about us! And please follow the other speakers (and us). Everyone wants more followers.

    <h2>Location, Getting There, Parking, etc.</h2>

We are at GMU's Arlington VA Founders Hall, rm 126 (the ballroom, on the left side of the building as seen from the street). Parking is possible under the building from the back side in the alley. You have to go around the back of the building to get in there, though. Also, the Virginia Square and Clarendon metro stops are just a couple of blocks from GMU. The location of the building is on the main web page, just click on that map and it will take you to Google maps to see where you are, or click this link:

    <h2>Backup Talks</h2>
    <p>
      As sometimes happens, we have one speaker who might have jury duty on the day of Frontrunners.
      We won't know the outcome of that until the last minute, unfortunately.
      So, if you have a second talk, and are willing to give that as a backup, we would appreciate it.
    </p>

    <h2>Did I Forget Something?</h2>

    <p>
Probably. If you have questions, let me know. Maybe I forgot something. If so, I will send another email. Thanks again for speaking!
