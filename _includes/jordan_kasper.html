TITLE: Everyone can be a Civic Tech Rockstar
Government agencies produce, store, and provide open access to hundreds of thousands of datasets. Teams within the General Services Administration (GSA) create reusable components not just for other agencies, but for everyone to use. Are they perfect? Of course not, but they serve a vital role in iteratively improving the public's access to data and services.
In this talk Jordan Kasper will discuss how he created a website built on top of those tools and data to solve a real world problem. He'll cover how to discover open datasets and APIs, give an intro to the US Web Design System, talk about open source software in the federal government, and show how every one of us can help improve civic technology for the greater good.
