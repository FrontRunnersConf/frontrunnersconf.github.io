    <h3 class="talk-title"> The Most Annoying Lesson to Learn</h3>

    <p class="talk-description">
      The lessons we are forced to learn as parents make us better managers, leaders, and teammates. 
      Parenting is stressful, difficult, and changes the very essence of your being. 
      It gives you high highs and low lows. 
      It forces individuals to reconcile their personality and approaches with these new tiny humans theyâ€™ve brought into the world. 
      Parents are challenged to think differently and leave their comfort zone in ways they could have never imagined. 
      When I became a parent, I had read the books and done the research and yet still, I was completely unprepared for the challenges that awaited me. 
      Learn about how these new perspectives impact the way you think about teamwork, conflict, compromise, and communication on engineering teams.
