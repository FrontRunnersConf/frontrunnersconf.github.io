    <h3 class="talk-title">Intro to Qwik: The Answer to Web App Scalability Issues</h3>

    <p class="talk-description">
      At scale everything breaks. 
      All the Angular and React in the world can't help, when even laws of physics break down at different scales. 
      Qwik is an upcoming new framework to build web applications with O(1) scalability. 
      It forgoes hydration in favor resumability and embraces server-side-rendering in a seamless/magical way. 
      Qwik has plans to implement React and Angular integrations in the future, so this is definitely a framework to watch and experiment with.
